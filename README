libgenekit v0.0.5
-----------------

INTRODUCTION

libgenekit is an open source C library made for evolutionary computation applications. 
It is designed to act as a single, standardized framework for various types of EC 
applications, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, symbolic regression,
etc. Currently it is in the early stages of development, and the overall architecture
of the library is likely to change drastically. This is my first major C project, so
any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Enjoy :)

INSTALLATION

The library itself is contained with the 'src' directory. I have included a single 
Makefile that can be used to build a static library. I intend to add autoconf 
support in later versions. In addition, there is sample code included in the
examples directory.
